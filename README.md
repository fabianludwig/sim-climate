# sim-climate

This projects aims to model all CO2 producing entities.
It can then be used to build things like simulators or games (or anything you can imagine), where you can test your idea or hypothesis. 
"What if there were only electronic cars? What if we shut down all coal plants?" ...

This can help to gain a better understanding of the climate crisis and which leverage is best to start with.

## Code

... should only contain logic and constant values. (For example chemical composition of elements). That stuff lives under "models".

The remaining data, that can change over time (for example: a list of all energy sources in germany) should always be taken from an external source. API? Crawler? etc.

### Code to learn from

Please make sure to always link urls to sites where you got your information from, so that everyone else is able to countercheck your logic and data.
